project information

## This is React App project for LITS

    It's application for monitoring budget.
    
From first sight it looks very simple and ordinary but :-) my app has a lot of options & functionality. I suppose this react app should be enough { after few improvements :-) } for ordinary monitoring user's money by categories, different accounts, transactions. The task was to create from scratch app (from one line of code to complete program) instead of creation award winning design. That's why design style light :-)


_program has such options_

   * Show & hide & update charts
     * _Charts are in bars for Accounts_
     * _Charts are in Pie for Categories_
   * PLUS money to Account
   * DELL Accounts, Categories
   * Create new Accounts, Categories
   * Add new transaction
     * _in new transaction form your can choose category & account_
   * in category on click you can see all transactions or empty list if nothing to show


_in this project I use_

   * React.js
   * JavaScript
   * ES6 ES7
   * Webpack 3
   * package.json
